## Node Modules issue. Unable to start the frontend

1. **Remove the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file**: Sometimes, the issue might be with the existing dependencies. You can try deleting the `node_modules` directory and the `package-lock.json` file, then reinstalling the dependencies:

   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   rm package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the start script again**: After following the above steps, try running the start script again:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

If everything is set up correctly, your React application should start without any issues. If you still encounter problems, please provide more details about your project setup, and I'll be happy to assist you further!
