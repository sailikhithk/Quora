    <h1>What is Python?</h1>
    <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is a versatile language that can be used for various applications, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.</p>

    <h1>Python Features</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Easy-to-read, clean, and concise syntax.</li>
        <li>Interpreted language, which means you can run Python code without the need for compilation.</li>
        <li>Support for object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.</li>
        <li>Large standard library with modules and packages for various tasks.</li>
        <li>Dynamic typing and automatic memory management (garbage collection).</li>
        <li>Extensible and embeddable, allowing integration with other languages like C/C++.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Python Example</h1>
    <pre>
<code>
# Hello, World! in Python
print("Hello, World!")
</code>
    </pre>

    <p>This simple Python code prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Python's clean syntax makes it easy to understand and use.</p>

    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
    <p>To get started with Python, you'll need to install it on your computer. You can download Python from the official website (<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">python.org</a>) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.</p>

    <p>Once Python is installed, you can use a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) to write and run Python code.</p>

    <p>Happy coding with Python!</p>
